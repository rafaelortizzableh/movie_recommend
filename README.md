# Movie Recommendation App

This project is my take of the project created on [Robert Brunhage's Ultimate Flutter Course](https://robertbrunhage.com/course). 

Apart from the functionalities specified on that project. This app includes Internalization allowing user to get both the app's strings and the movie results in Spanish or English. 

## Getting Started

You need an API KEY from TMDB to build or run this app. Get your API key from [here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

Once you have an api, declare it as an environment variable with `-dart-define=MOVIE_API=YOUR_API_KEY`.
